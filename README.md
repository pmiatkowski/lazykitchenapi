For my beautiful wife. Simple API server for the development purpose of her frontend react app.

## Commands

- `npm start` or `npm run watch` - starts server development
- `npm run start:prod` - runs server in production mode - outputs files into _server_ folder and starts script with **nodemon**
- `npm run lint` and `npm run lint:fix` - self explanatory

## Configuration

Injecting environment variables is done via _.env-cmdrc_ file.
